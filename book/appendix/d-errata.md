# Errata

This page lists every **never-true claim** the book has published: statements about what a primary source says that the source contradicts, and places where the book contradicted itself. Each was wrong on the day it was written. They are listed here in full, with what the source actually says and the version that fixed them. A book that asks you to read reports critically should show you its own mistakes.

Stale claims are different: those were accurate when written and have since been overtaken by newer work. They are not listed here. They go in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md), and each chapter's currency stamp tells you how recently it was checked.

The text as first published is tagged `v1.0` in the repository, so every "the book said" below can be checked.

**If you worked an exercise before v1.0.1**, look for an *If you worked this before v1.0.1* line. Some corrections change a final answer, and a few reverse the conclusion.

### E-001 — The DeepSeek-V3 parallelism layout

- **The book said:** "4 (PP) × 8 (EP, which is also the node size) × 64 (DP)", over "60 transformer layers" split into 4 stages of 15, with "small TP" for dense layers. It also said V3 kept expert parallelism inside a node, on NVLink, and that this was "why DeepSeek's EP choice is exactly the node size".
- **The source says:** 16-way pipeline parallelism, 64-way expert parallelism spanning 8 nodes, ZeRO-1 data parallelism, and no tensor parallelism at all, over 61 layers. Expert parallelism deliberately crosses node boundaries. That is affordable because DualPipe overlaps the all-to-all with compute, and because each token is routed to at most 4 nodes. See the [fact sheet](fact-sheets/deepseek-v3.md#parallelism-layout).
- **Where:** Chapter 1 §1.5; Chapter 6 §6.10, §6.11, §6.13 and takeaways 8–9; Chapter 7 §7.3 and §7.4; Chapter 10 §10.7, its parallelism block, and takeaway 4; Exercise 6.6 and its solution. Solutions 6.9 and 10.1 already gave the correct layout, contradicting the chapters; they now link to the fact sheet.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1
- **If you worked this before v1.0.1:** Exercise 6.6 part 4 now uses 58 MoE layers, so the answer is ~55 GB per micro-batch rather than 56 (~870 GB per step rather than ~900). Part 5's conclusion changes more. "EP belongs inside a node" is a sound default, but it is not what V3 did, and V3 is the book's anchor example. V3's design point is cross-node EP made cheap, and it is the more interesting lesson.

### E-002 — The Chapter 4 tokenizer configurations

- **The book said:** three JSON blocks presented as the published tokenizer files for DeepSeek-V3, Llama-3 and Qwen3. All three had `"byte_fallback": true`, merge counts of 127,744 or 151,808, invented special tokens (`<|fim_begin|>`, `<|tool_call|>`), and a Qwen3 vocabulary of 152,064. §4.5 said Llama-3 "reserves 128 special tokens".
- **The source says:** `byte_fallback` is `false` in all three published `tokenizer.json` files. Merges are 127,741 (DeepSeek-V3), 280,147 (Llama-3) and 151,387 (Qwen3). Llama-3 has 256 special tokens. Qwen3 has 151,643 BPE entries plus 26 added (151,669, as its report says), padded to 151,936 embedding rows. The blocks are now generated from the hash-verified files; see the [tokenizer fact sheet](fact-sheets/tokenizers.md).
- **Where:** Chapter 4 §4.4 (vocabulary table), §4.5 (special tokens), §4.11 (all three blocks); Solution 4.7 part 1.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1

### E-003 — Which tokenizer isolates CJK, and which is "Chinese-optimized"

- **The book said:** Qwen3's pre-tokenizer adds a `[\p{Han}\p{Katakana}\p{Hiragana}\p{Hangul}]+` class, "which is what lets the tokenizer build a vocabulary" of Chinese tokens, and its "152K vocabulary is heavily Chinese-optimized, with a large fraction of merges" producing Chinese characters. It also said Qwen3 and Llama-3 split digits into 1–3 digit chunks, and showed possessive quantifiers in both regexes.
- **The source says:** Qwen3's published pre-tokenizer has **no CJK class**. It splits digits **one at a time**, and it differs from Llama-3's only in that. The tokenizer that isolates CJK runs is **DeepSeek-V3**'s. Counting the vocabularies, DeepSeek-V3 has 35,334 entries containing Han, Qwen3 25,511 and Llama-3 4,387, and the Qwen3 report says nothing about Chinese optimization. The published regexes have no possessive quantifiers. See the [tokenizer fact sheet](fact-sheets/tokenizers.md).
- **Where:** Chapter 4 §4.6, §4.8, §4.11 and takeaway 4.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1
- **If you read this before v1.0.1:** the chapter's causal story ran the wrong way. Qwen's efficiency on Chinese, whatever its size, is not explained by a CJK pre-tokenizer rule. The lesson that survives is the chapter's own: pre-tokenization matters, and you check it by opening the file.

### E-004 — Llama-3's embeddings and width

- **The book said:** "Llama-3 uses *tied* embeddings". Its vocabulary table gave `d_model = 4,096` for "Llama-3 (8B/70B/405B)".
- **The source says:** `tie_word_embeddings` is `false` in the Llama-3 config, and in DeepSeek-V3's and Qwen3's too. 4,096 is the 8B model's width only; the 70B and 405B models are wider. See the [tokenizer fact sheet](fact-sheets/tokenizers.md#llama-3).
- **Where:** Chapter 4 §4.4; Solution 5.1, which offered tied embeddings as an explanation.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1

### E-005 — A history attributed to the DeepSeek-V3 report

- **The book said:** DeepSeek-V3's 128K vocabulary was chosen "partly because they started from a 32K Llama-1-style tokenizer and grew it", citing the V3 report.
- **The source says:** only that the tokenizer is byte-level BPE "with an extended vocabulary of 128K tokens", with its pre-tokenizer and training data "modified to optimize multilingual compression efficiency" ([V3] §4.1). The history does not appear in the report.
- **Where:** Chapter 4 §4.10.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1

### E-006 — An invented config presented as real

- **The book said:** "A real Megatron-LM-style configuration file for a 70B-scale model on 1,024 H100s".
- **The source says:** it is not any lab's file; the book wrote it to show the shape of a 3D-parallel config. It is now labelled illustrative, as are the similar blocks in Chapters 6 and 9. The book's rule is now that a real config is generated from the published file, and anything else says so.
- **Where:** Chapter 1 §1.5; Chapter 6 §6.9; Chapter 9 §9.6.
- **Fixed in:** v1.0.1
